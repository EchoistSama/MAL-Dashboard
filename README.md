# MAL-Dashboard
 A dashboard created out of MyAnimeList's(My data) exported XML dataset.


MAL(MyAnimeList) allows users to keep track of their anime using an extremely convenient to use database. I have personally used MAL for the last 6 years. I have exported my own MAL data as an XML file, cleaned the data in Excel after converting it to a CSV and have created a Power BI dashboard as can be seen in the following screenshots.

Upon selecting a random anime from the multi-row card on the left, you can see data such as score, episode count, season(the season when it aired), type(TV, Movie, ONA, ,etc), start date, end date, and the number of days take to finish the anime
